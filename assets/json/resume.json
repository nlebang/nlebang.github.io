In such situations, microgrids could be considered the last available resource to provide energy to critical infrastructure."},{"name":"Family of integrated multi-input multi-output DC-DC power converters","publisher":"2018 International Power Electronics Conference","releaseDate":"2018","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8507791","summary":"his paper explores a family of integrated multiport converters using three-switch which can provide single-input dual-output (SIDO) or dual-input single-output (DISO) with bidirectional power flow between any two ports. The concept can be extended to the n-switch converters to achieve more inputs and/or outputs. The proposed converters can be applied to interfacing sources, loads and storage elements having different voltage levels in applications such as dc nanogrids, electric vehicle, multiport power supplies, distributed generation systems."},{"name":"Single-phase six-switch dual-output inverter using dual-buck structure","publisher":"IEEE Transactions on Power Electronics","releaseDate":"2017","url":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8113490","summary":"In this paper, a novel six-switch dual-output inverter is proposed. The three-switch leg in the proposed inverter is implemented with the dual-buck structure. Hence, it retains all the benefits of the conventional dual-buck inverter such as improved reliability owing to the absence of short-circuit problems and higher efficiency with the use of power metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (mosfet) without reverse recovery issues on its body diode. In addition, the passive components can be reduced with the high switching frequency operation."}],"skills":[{"name":"Power Electronics","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["SCH, PCB design, test, debug","Embeded programming","Magnetic design","Modeling, simulation","Hardware-in-the-loop","System integration"]},{"name":"Power System","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Large system modeling, simulation","Real-time and HIL validation","Optimization","Data analysis","Control and Management",]},{"name":"Machine Learning & software","level":"Master","icon":"fa-solid fa-hashtag","keywords":["Anomaly detection","Pytorch, Tensorflow","Back-end programming","Data visualization",]}],"languages":[{"language":"Vietnamese","fluency":"Native speaker","icon":""},{"language":"English","fluency":"Fluent","icon":""},{"language":"Korean","fluency":"Beginner","icon":""}],"references":[{"name":"Tuyen Vu, Ph.D.","icon":"fa-solid fa-laptop","reference":"Tuyen Vu is my PhD advisor.
