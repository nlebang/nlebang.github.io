abstract = {This paper proposes a joint input and state dynamic estimation scheme for power networks in microgrids and active distribution systems with unknown inputs. The conventional dynamic state estimation of power networks in the transmission system relies on the forecasting methods to obtain the state-transition model of state variables. However, under highly dynamic conditions in the operation of microgrids and active distribution networks, this approach may become ineffective as the forecasting accuracy is not guaranteed. To overcome such drawbacks, this paper employs the power networks model derived from the physical equations of branch currents. Specifically, the power network model is a linear state-space model, in which the state vector consists of branch currents, and the input vector consists of bus voltages. To estimate both state and input variables, we propose linear Kalman-based dynamic filtering algorithms in batch-mode regression form, considering the cross-correlation between states and inputs. For the scalability of the proposed scheme, the distributed implementation is also presented. Complementarily, the predicted state and input vectors are leveraged for bad data detection. Results carried out on a 13-bus microgrid system in real-time Opal-RT platform demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in comparison with the traditional weighted least square and tracking state estimation methods.}

abstract = {Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a noninvasively technique used to detect vital signs such as heart rate (HR), saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2) and blood pressure (BP). Recently, wearable finger-type PPG devices are increasingly developed toward convenience of person under monitoring (PUM). Two most critical features of wearable PPG devices are high accuracy and long operation time. To enhance these functions, this paper proposes a new architecture to select, process and transfer only high quality PPG signals. Hence, data quality is significantly improved and power consumption on wireless module is minimized. In the proposed architecture, parameters of PPG sensor are reconfigured in real-time being suitable with skin characteristics of PUM. Moreover, the adaptive LED current control algorithm is proposed to dynamically change the LED current to remove various motion artifacts (MA) and get high amplitude PPG signal. We also develop a heart rate (HR) estimation framework utilizing deep learning (DL) model based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) network. The combination of CNN-LSTM can extract features from both spatial and temporal correlation. A light-weight model with two CNN-LSTM layers is built to estimate HR with in only 5s. For validation, we conduct experiments with volunteers doing various physical exercises. The results show PPG signals with high amplitude and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). HR estimation is more accurate even during irregular and muscle strength exercises. The proposed adaptive architecture and DL-based HR estimation can overcome MA and minimize the power consumption on wireless transfer module of wearable PPG devices.}

title = {Improved accuracy of optical distance sensor based on artificial neural network applied to real-time systems},
journal = {Measurement Science and Technology},
abstract = {Optical time-of-flight sensors have potential in the revolution of distance measurement. These sensors can continuously monitor the distance and track the movement of objects. However, the existing sensing methods for such distance optical sensors mainly calculate the flight time, e.g. pulse transmission and receiving time, without considering the environmental effects. Therefore, the measurement accuracy is severely reduced. There are other technologies with higher accuracy in distance measurement. Nonetheless, they are too expensive due to the high accurate power supply. In this paper, we innovatively improve the accuracy of continuous distance measurement using the artificial neural network (ANN) technique. The proposed method can be applied for very cheap optical distance sensors with analog output in a real-time system. Moreover, the proposed method can self-calibrate and be miniaturized for cheap analog sensor applications. The prototype is built with the infrared sensor GP2Y0A02YK0F and an Arduino control board (ESP32_DevC), and the ANN is implemented using the deep learning algorithm. The test results show that the distance measurement accuracy is significantly improved and the measuring range is increased from 15 to 150 cm. In addition, we calculate mean squared error, mean absolute error, mean bias error, and R 2 for further performance evaluation. The experimental results have proven the superiority of the proposed ANN method in optical distance measurement. The proposed method can be applied to many types of sensors.}

abstract = {This paper presents an original energy management methodology to enhance the resilience of ship power systems. The integration of various energy storage systems (ESS), including battery energy storage systems (BESS) and super-capacitor energy storage systems (SCESS), in modern ship power systems poses challenges in designing an efficient energy management system (EMS). The EMS proposed in this paper aims to achieve multiple objectives. The primary objective is to minimize shed loads, while the secondary objective is to effectively manage different types of ESS. Considering the diverse ramp-rate characteristics of generators, SCESS, and BESS, the proposed EMS exploits these differences to determine an optimal long-term schedule for minimizing shed loads. Furthermore, the proposed EMS balances the state-of-charge (SoC) of ESS and prioritizes the SCESS’s SoC levels to ensure the efficient operation of BESS and SCESS. For better computational efficiency, we introduce the receding horizon optimization method, enabling real-time EMS implementation. A comparison with the fixed horizon optimization (FHO) validates its effectiveness. Simulation studies and results demonstrate that the proposed EMS efficiently manages generators, BESS, and SCESS, ensuring system resilience under generation shortages. Additionally, the proposed methodology significantly reduces the computational burden compared to the FHO technique while maintaining acceptable resilience performance.}

abstract = {State estimation is highly critical for accurately observing the dynamic behavior of the power grids and minimizing risks from cyber threats. However, existing state estimation methods encounter challenges in accurately capturing power system dynamics, primarily because of limitations in encoding the grid topology and sparse measurements. This paper proposes a physics-informed graphical learning state estimation method to address these limitations by leveraging both domain physical knowledge and a graph neural network (GNN). We employ a GNN architecture that can handle the graph-structured data of power systems more effectively than traditional data-driven methods. The physics-based knowledge is constructed from the branch current formulation, making the approach adaptable to both transmission and distribution systems. The validation results of three IEEE test systems show that the proposed method can achieve lower mean square error more than 20% than the conventional methods.}
